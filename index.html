    <h2>From Amsterdam to Tbilisi by train</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>In July 2024 I went on a great summer trip, going from my home in Amsterdam, Netherlands to Tbilisi, Georgia (·Éó·Éë·Éò·Éö·Éò·É°·Éò, ·É°·Éê·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éù). While for sure I was looking forward to the destination, at least half the trip (by time and by what I saw) was the journey itself and the places on the way - I went by train (and more, read on!).
While I‚Äôve done longer trips in the past, for example Amsterdam to Thessaloniki in Greece (where a small part also made it onto my blog), this was by far the longest and furthest I‚Äôve travelled like that. And apart from a trip to Taiwan it was the furthest I‚Äôve ever travelled away from home.

    <h2>My website and blog is available via Gemini</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Gemini is a neat piece of technology. The Gemini protocol somewhat comparable to HTTP and the Gemtext file format comparable to HTML. But it‚Äôs simple. Like so simple that writing a client or server is actually doable.
All popular web browsers (Chromium and its skins - and Firefox) have their roots in the 1990‚Äôs and there hasn‚Äôt been any new web browser becoming usable in many years. Not because people haven‚Äôt tried - I‚Äôm sure many people have - but because the standards around the modern web are so gigantic that it‚Äôs just not feasable to develop a web browser from scratch.

    <h2>An eSIM manager for Mobile Linux</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>For a while eSIM management on Mobile Linux, such as postmarketOS, was just a dream. Now it‚Äôs real!
Background Nowadays many smartphones and other devices have a so-called eSIM - or eUICC - built-in to the device. This eSIM is essentially a chip on the PCB of the device that allows an end user to download a SIM profile - essentially all the data of a SIM card - to said chip and then the modem of the device can use that chip the same way as it would use any physical SIM card you insert.

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>In April 2023 I‚Äôve built myself a new NAS box to replace a rather old HPE ProLiant MicroServer Gen8 at my parents place. Since I don‚Äôt really have any good space in my apartment it needed to fit under my bed and be reasonably quiet.
After hearing good things about the ODROID H3&#43; I‚Äôve decided to order one with a case, hard drives and everything else necessary to fulfil this purpose.

   <p>All information as of July 2023.
Taking the Grimaldi lines ferry from Brindisi to Igoumenitsa (ŒóŒ≥ŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒØœÑœÉŒ±) as a pedestrian sounds easy enough. You can easily book the tickets online (don‚Äôt forget about the Interrail discount if you have a pass) but after booking it becomes a little bit more tricky.
Step 1: Get to the ferry terminal You will want to go to the bus station named ‚ÄúCosta Morena‚Äù (OpenStreetMap, Google Maps). The bus line ‚ÄúAP‚Äù from STP Brindisi is going there, according to the current schedule (valid from 2023-05-23) it appears to run every 30 minutes during the day. A ticket is ‚Ç¨2 per person, you can pay by cash in the bus.

    <h2>Mounting Android Retrofit Dynamic Partition images</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Android devices launching with Android 10 and newer use a feature called Dynamic Partitions which essentially combines the system_a, vendor_a and product_a (and all the _b) variants into a single partition simplying the actual partition layout while making it more flexible. Think of it like a single physical partition which contains multiple logical partitions, like with LVM.
This feature is available on newly launched devices, devices launched with earlier Android versions still have to cope with the rigid partition layout on-disk. For this Android has introduced a way to retrofit dynamic partitions onto exiting the existing partition layout.

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Today I have tried adding my PayPal account to my iTunes (installed with Wine) Account but discovered, that adding my PayPal account as a payment method didn‚Äôt work. After inspecting the network traffic, I found that my browser (Firefox) was redirected to an itmss:// URL, but Firefox didn‚Äôt know how to handle that and did nothing. To get it working yourself, follow the next steps:
Assuming you already have iTunes installed and are using Firefox, open about:config in Firefox, accept the prompt, right-click and select New -&gt; Boolean. In the dialog enter network.protocol-handler.expose.itmss as preference name and select false as value. After that, restart Firefox.

   <p>If you are wondering how you can login with a Yubikey into your system with SDDM, here are the steps:
Step 1: Install yubico-pam from [community].
Step 2: Edit the file /etc/yubikeys and insert text in the following format:
&lt;username&gt;:&lt;yubikey_token_id&gt; # eg luca:cclcclcclccl If you don‚Äôt know what the token ID from your yubikey is, just open a text editor and press the button on your yubikey to create a one time password (=OTP). Then take the first twelve characters from that string, which is your token id. If you are too lazy to count, you can also press the button multiple times and take the part that stays the same at the beginning.
